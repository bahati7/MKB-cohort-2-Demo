# MKB-cohort-2-Demo
Where the MichaelKentBurns.com students can demonstrate what they have learned.
This repository serves as the foundation for a Collaborative Learning Experience Feedback Application project version 2 by the MichaelKentBurns.com students.  Here, you'll gain practical experience by building an application to collect feedback on your learning journey.

## Purpose of this repository

We've just finished learning UML and especially the use case diagram, and we're looking forward to putting our knowledge into practice through this project. This repository is the central hub for our collaborative project: building an application that collects feedback from students about their learning experience. The application will feature user authentication (signup and sign-in) and a form with a series of questions. Upon submission, the application will generate a JSON file containing the student's responses, saving it locally within the `responses` directory of each student's repository and also storing the data in a backend database.
.Additional functionalities may be introduced throughout the project through designated "issues" within this repository.

## Requirements:

Work together to build out this repository with an application that will ask each of you to answer a set of questions about your learning experience.  It will present a form that identifies you as a student, and asks a series of questions.  When you fill out the form, the page will construct a json file with the results and save that file in the responses directory in your copy of this repository.  There will be additional requirements added as issues in this repository.  

## Collaboration Guidelines:
1. Each team member will clone this repository and do their part of the work in their copy.
2. Everything done will be in response to an issue in this repository.  That is, the team leader will create issues, and you as a team will design the solution together by creating new issues and then completing them. 
3. Before any changes can be pushed, test your script or work with your team member.
4. Every commit of any material will identify the issue by number and title that is addressed by the commit.  You may commit many times to an issue until it is complete and closed.
5. The work to be done for an issue will be described in the issue, and the team will use the issue comments to work together to agree on what needs to be done and who will do the work.  
6. After each commit and push to this original repository, the other team members should review the changes, verify the test results, and approve or suggest changes needed.  

## Project Workflow

Our project will proceed in the following stages:

1.  **Use Case Definition (This Stage):** Each team will be assigned a specific use case (detailed in the **Issues** tab) related to the overall project. The goal of this stage is to thoroughly understand and document the functionality of that specific use case.
2.  **Use Case Diagramming:** Once the use cases are well-defined, we will create visual representations (use case diagrams) to illustrate the interactions between users and the system for each use case.
3.  **Coding:** Following the diagramming phase, we will begin the development of the application, implementing the functionalities defined in the use cases.

## Team roles:

### Project owner: Michael
This person defines the requirements and completion criteria.  The owner also invites the initial people to join the team, and assigns initial roles.
### Team lead: Philemon 
Oversees the creation of high-level issues, ensuring each team member has a clear starting point for their assigned tasks.
Acts as a central point of communication and facilitates collaboration among team members.


## Getting Started

1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Navigate to the Issues tab** of this repository.
3.  **Identify the use case** assigned to your team.
4.  **Begin working on documenting the use case** as described in the next section.

### Prerequisites
- Git
- UML
- JavaScript
- MySQL

## Skills Demonstrated

This project involved a variety of skills:

* **Front-End Development:** Building a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript ([https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn]).
* **Back-End Development:** Processing form submissions and potentially storing data in a database (if applicable) ([https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn]).
* **Testing:** Writing unit tests to ensure code quality ([https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started]).
* **Collaboration:** Working effectively in a team using Git for version control ([https://git-scm.com/doc]).
* **UML Modeling:** Creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to visualize the system's structure and behavior.
    * **Use Case Diagrams:** Developing diagrams to represent the different ways users interact with the application to achieve specific goals. These diagrams help in understanding the system's functionality from a user's perspective. ([https://www.justinmind.com/blog/use-case-diagramming-examples/]).
