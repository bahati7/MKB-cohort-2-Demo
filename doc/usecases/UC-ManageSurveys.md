Use Case: Manage survey.
=================================
**Actors**: Instructor, Administor

**Scope**: Software system

**Purpose**: Enable instructors to create, edit, and delete surveys for students.

**Type**: Primary 

**Overview**: This use case describes how an instructor manages surveys within the system.  
the instructor can create new surveys, edit existing ones, and delete those that are no longer needed.  
the system provides an intuitive interface to easily manage surveys to ensure they remain up-to-date  
and relevant to participant needs. This process facilitates the collection of relevant data  
and preparation of surveys for effective delivery.
