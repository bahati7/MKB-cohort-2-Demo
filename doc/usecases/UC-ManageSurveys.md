Use Case: Manage survey.
=================================
**Actors**: Instructor, Administor

**Scope**: Software system

**Purpose**: Enable instructors to create, edit, and delete surveys for students.

**Type**: Primary 

**Overview**: This use case describes how an instructor manages surveys within the system.  
the instructor can create new surveys, edit existing ones, and delete those that are no longer needed.  
the system provides an intuitive interface to easily manage surveys to ensure they remain up-to-date  
and relevant to participant needs. This process facilitates the collection of relevant data  
and preparation of surveys for effective delivery.


Typical course of events:
----------------------

| Actor Action | System Response |
|:--------------|:----------------|
| 1. The Instructor navigates to the survey management section of the system. | 2. The system displays a list of existing surveys created by the instructor, along with options to create a new survey, edit an existing one, or delete a survey. |
| 3. The Instructor chooses to either:
3a. The Instructor selects the "Create New Survey" option. | 4. The system presents the Instructor with an interface to define survey details such as title, description, opening date, and closing date. |
| 3b. The Instructor selects a survey from the list. | (This action leads to further steps for editing, not a direct system response at this point in the typical flow.) |
| 3c. The Instructor selects a survey from the list and chooses the "Delete" option. | (This action leads to a confirmation and deletion, likely a subsequent system response.) |
| 5. The Instructor enters the survey details and proceeds to add questions. | 6. The system provides tools for the Instructor to create different types of questions (e.g., multiple choice, text-based), define answer options, and mark questions as mandatory or optional. |
